This project creates a generic interface, a generic class, a regular class, and a MainEntry class.

It uses a constructor to assign key of type K and value of type V to "key" and "value" attributes

It has two methods, getKey() and getValue() which assign values to key and value.

There is a method getSum that takes two inputs of type T and returns the first input.

In the mainEntry, the program prints out the key and value of mgi1 and mgi2 and then it prints out i1 and f1.
